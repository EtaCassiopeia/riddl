# ossum

## Introduction
Ossum is a tool for eliminating the boilerplate from reactive systems. 
It uses a DDD inspired specification language to allow developers to 
work at a higher level of specification (and detail) than they would if they
were coding directly in a programming language. It aims to relieve development
of the burden of maintaining infrastructural code through evolution of the
domain abstractions.
