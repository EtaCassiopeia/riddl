RIDDL is a language and toolset for specifying a system design 
using a combination of unique ideas and ideas from prior works. 
Before we get into the details, this documentation has multiple
paths by which you can learn RIDDL, depending on how you learn.

Everyone should read the [Introduction](introduction) section as it
provides a high level introduction to RIDDL, defines what RIDDL is, 
what it can do, and what it is based upon.  Definitely start 
with the [Introduction](introduction) if you're new to RIDDL.

There is an [Audiences](audience) section which provides learning 
paths for different kinds of readers, to wit:
* [Domain Expert's Guide](audience/expertsGuide): for knowledge 
  domain experts who would provide concepts, structure, and event flows
  to a RIDDL author. Domain experts are generally not required to deal
  with the RIDDL language itself but do need to be familiar with its
  concepts and facilities. 
* [Author's Guide](audience/authorsGuide): for those who will write 
  RIDDL specifications and must know the language intricacies for full
  and accurate specifications. 
* [Implementor's Guide](audience/implementorsGuide): for those who will 
  implement software systems based on RIDDL specifications and the output of 
  RIDDL based tools
* [Developer's Guide](audience/developersGuide): for those who will work on 
  the RIDDL software itself and tools such as `riddlc` 

For those that like to learn incrementally, there is a [Tutorial](tutorial) 
section which walks the reader through the construction of a RIDDL model for
a restaurant chain, and the resulting software system to operate it.

For those that like to learn by example, the model produced in the 
[Tutorial](tutorial) is presented, step-by-step, with new concepts added 
as they occur.
