RIDDL eliminates the boilerplate code from micro-services implementations for
reactive systems designed with Domain Driven Design (DDD). The RIDDL uses a
DDD-inspired specification language to allow domain experts and developers
to work at a higher level of specification than they would if they
were coding directly in a programming language. It aims to relieve developers
of the burden of maintaining infrastructural code through evolution of the
domain abstractions. It also aims to aide the domain expert with a rigorous
but simple language to use for a specification.

Once a domain is specified in RIDDL, the Ossum tools can be used to generate
documentation, diagrams, infrastructure code, API definitions, and anything
else that is needful.

For best comprehension of the language, it is best to be familiar with the
DDD concepts. For a four minute overview,
[watch this video](https://elearn.domainlanguage.com/). For a more in depth
understanding, we recommend reading Vaughn Vernon's more concise book **[Domain
Driven Design Distilled](https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Distilled-Vaughn-Vernon-ebook/dp/B01JJSGE5S/ref=sr_1_1)**
or Eric Evans' original tome **[Domain Driven Design](https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software-ebook/dp/B00794TAUG/ref=pd_sim_351_2/139-5372630-4190805)**.

RIDDL is one of the Ossum tools. Ossum is a collection of tools for making
awesome software systems based on reactive architecture.
