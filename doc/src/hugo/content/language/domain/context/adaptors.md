# Introduction
Adaptors are translators between contexts and domains. 
DDD calls these "anti-corruption layers" which we find awkward, hence the
rename.  However, the name DDD chose is apt.  Adaptors aim to solve a language
problem that often exists in large domain modelling exercises: conflation and
overloading of terms.
