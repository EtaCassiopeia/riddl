Adaptors are translators between contexts and domains. 
DDD calls these "anti-corruption layers" which we find awkward, hence we
renamed them to adaptors.  However, the name DDD chose is apt.  Adaptors aim to 
solve a language problem that often exists in large domain modelling exercises: 
conflation and overloading of terms.
