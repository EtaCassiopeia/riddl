  brief "Reactive BBQ Domain Definition"
  details {
    |This domain definition is designed to be instructive in the RIDDL language.
    |It uses the case study from the Lightbend Reactive Architecture course as
    |the basis for defining the domain. The course uses a set of interviews with
    |Reactive BBQ employees to define the requirements. This domain specification
    |is a possible result of analyzing that domain: the Reactive BBQ restaurant.
