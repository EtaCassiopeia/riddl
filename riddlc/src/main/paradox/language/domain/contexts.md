# Contexts

### Introduction
DDD defines the notion of a **bounded context** which is portion of the domain
in which the terminology is well defined. Contexts in RIDDL represent exactly 
the same concept and are basically a container of various definitions that 
will be generated into a micro-service definition.  They also support some other
generic RIDDL constructs such as `types`, `interactions` and `adaptors`.

Contexts encapsulate all the definitions of a DDD bounded context, specifically:
