# Language

## Overview
This section defines the RIDDL syntax.  RIDDL is aimed not at software
developers but business analysts, domain experts, and domain engineers. It
tries hard to be readable in English and not overly technical while still
retaining the ability to be precise, concise and specific. The principles
of Domain Driven Design are upheld while some of the details have been 
changed or adapted specifically for implementation via a reactive system.
Thus, RIDDL is opinionated and specific. It does not attempt to solve every
kind of computing problem nor even every kind of knowledge domain.  

Here are the main concepts the language supports:
