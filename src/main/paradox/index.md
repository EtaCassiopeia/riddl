# IDDDL

IDDDL, the Interface for Domain Driven Definition Language, is a tool for
generating code and documentation from a high level definition based on 
DDD concepts.

## Introduction 
IDDDL eliminates the boilerplate code from microservices implementations of
systems designed with Domain Driven Design (DDD). The IDDL uses a DDD 
inspired specification language to allow developers to 
work at a higher level of specification than they would if they
were coding directly in a programming language. It aims to relieve developers
of the burden of maintaining infrastructural code through evolution of the
domain abstractions.

For best comprehension of the language, it is best to be familiar with the
DDD concepts. For a four minute overview, 
[watch this video](https://elearn.domainlanguage.com/). For a more in depth
understanding, we recommend reading the Vaughn Vernon's book **Domain
Driven Design Distilled**.

IDDDL is one of the Ossum tools. Ossum is a collection of tools for making
awesome software systems based on reactive architecture.
