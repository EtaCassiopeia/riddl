# Interface to Domain Driven Definition Language (IDDDL)

# Overview
IDDDL, the Interface for Domain Driven Definition Language, is a tool for
eliminating the boilerplate from reactive systems designed with DDD.   
It uses a DDD inspired specification language to allow developers to 
work at a higher level of specification than they would if they
were coding directly in a programming language. It aims to relieve developers
of the burden of maintaining infrastructural code through evolution of the
domain abstractions.

IDDDL is one of the Ossum tools. Ossum is a collection of tools for making
awesome software systems based on reactive architecture.
