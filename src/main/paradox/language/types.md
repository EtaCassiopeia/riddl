# Types

## Introduction
The IDDD Language allows users to define data types. Definitions of types
are more limited in IDDDL than in programming languages on purpose. The
type system must be easily understandable by non-programmers as the domain
engineer or domain expert is likely the most frequent user. 

## Literal Types
IDDDL supports several literal types that just "exist" because they are
fundamental and well understood in any targeted computing environment. The 
literal types are:

* String - a sequence of characters with a finite length
* Number  - a numeric value either integer or real
*
